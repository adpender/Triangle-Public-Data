	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>One note on this project: we decided to portray these data through these graphs not to suggest definitive solutions to the issue of resource misallocation within Durham county, but rather to demonstrate the reality that even the most basic of public services and resources inherently show bias towards different communities, thereby suggesting that more concrete answers must be developed in the future to address the issues of social inequality. </p>
	<p>Vishy Luhadia is a freshman at UNC Chapel Hill from Cary, North Carolina. He enjoys playing video games, watching football, and hanging out with friends.</p>
	<p>Jake Browne is a Computer Science major at UNC Chapel Hill originally from Stamford, CT, but currently residing in the Winston-Salem, NC area. As a Pogue scholar, he is particularly involved in the political realm, and served as the former Vice President of the Young Democrats of Forsyth County. With these combined experiences, he is particularly suited to utilize technology to examine issues of social inequality.</p>
	<p>Andrew Pendergast is Biochemistry and Computer Science double major at UNC Chapel Hill hailing from Waxhaw, North Carolina. As a Col. Robinson scholar, Andrew is currently working towards analyzing the intersections of the chemical and computer worlds in a dynamically changing information oriented science paradigm. </p>
